A TensorFlow implementation of [Matrix Capsules with EM Routing](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJWLfGWRb) by Hinton *et al.* (2018) that fixes some common errors in other open source implementations, and gets much closer to the accuracy reported by the original authors.

Please *watch* this repo if you are interested.
